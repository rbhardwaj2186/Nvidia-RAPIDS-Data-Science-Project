This project demonstrates the use of NVIDIA RAPIDS and Dask to accelerate data processing and machine learning workflows using GPU technology. The primary dataset used is the Census dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, commonly used for classification tasks.
Project Overview
Key Technologies:

    NVIDIA RAPIDS: Accelerates data science pipelines using GPU-based computation for tasks that would traditionally run on CPUs.
    cuDF: RAPIDS' DataFrame library that mimics pandas but operates on the GPU.
    Dask: Enables scalable and distributed computing across larger datasets.
    cuML: Machine learning library for RAPIDS that provides GPU-accelerated algorithms.

Dataset:

    Census (Adult) Dataset:
        The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is widely used for predictive modeling tasks like classification. You can find more information here.

Features:

    Fast, GPU-accelerated data manipulation using cuDF for DataFrame operations.
    Distributed and scalable data processing with Dask, improving performance on larger datasets.
    Machine learning model training using cuML to accelerate model building and evaluation.
    Visualizations with matplotlib to track model performance.
