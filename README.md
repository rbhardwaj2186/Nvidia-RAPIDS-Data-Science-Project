# Nvidia RAPIDS Data Science Project
 The data science project focuses on using NVIDIA RAPIDS and Dask to accelerate large-scale data processing and machine learning tasks by leveraging GPU power. The project applies these technologies to process and analyze the Census dataset, a commonly used dataset for classification and regression tasks. It involves data manipulation, distributed computing, and machine learning model training on GPUs to optimize performance and scalability. The project's goal is to demonstrate how GPU-accelerated data science workflows can significantly reduce processing times and improve decision-making capabilities for businesses handling large datasets.
